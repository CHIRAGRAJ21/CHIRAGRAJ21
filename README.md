This is a wholly designed printed circuit board for a microcontroller data logger. The data logger is based on an Atmega 328P-AU microcontroller and is supported by two EEPROMs and a real-time clock. 

Additional components on the board, such as status LEDs with their supporting resistors, two crystal oscillators, connectors, and capacitors. 
SMD packages for most components are used on a rectangular two layer board with mounting holes on the four corners. 
The project highlights are: 
  1. Git is used to capture the history of the project’s development.
  2. Two versions of the PCB are designed : one with two layers and one with four layers. Both will use data from the same schematic design.

KiCad, on its own, does not allow the creation of more than one layout for a schematic. Git makes this possible with the use of branches. This project allows to practice this aspect of Git-powered PCB design with KiCad.
